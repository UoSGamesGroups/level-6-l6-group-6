# Task Plans

This folder should contain the plan for your tasks, should you need to write one. This way if you've written up a plan for a task, there's a place on the Repo you can put it for future referance.

Make sure that your file is named starting with the Jira issue code and then your descriptive title as follows:

*L616G6-53_ReexportPlan.txt*
